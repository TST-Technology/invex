The CPI\n                        reflects spending patterns for each of two population\n                        groups: all urban consumers and urban wage earners and\n                        clerical workers. The all urban consumer group\n                        represents about 93 percent of the total U.S.\n                        population. It is based on the expenditures of almost\n                        all residents of urban or metropolitan areas, including\n                        professionals, the self-employed, the poor, the\n                        unemployed, and retired people, as well as urban wage\n                        earners and clerical workers. Not included in the CPI\n                        are the spending patterns of people living in rural\n                        non-metropolitan areas, farming families, people in the\n                        Armed Forces, and those in institutions, such as prisons\n                        and mental hospitals.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        The CPI is constructed by taking the weighted averages\n                        of prices on a wide variety of items which are assigned\n                        weights representing their importance within groups.\n                        Prices are collected monthly from 4000 Housing units and\n                        around 26000 Retail establushments across 87 Urban areas\n                        of the US. However, The CPI is a coincident indicator,\n                        i.e, it tells you what is happening in the Economy now\n                        rather than in the future.

It is considered to be a key indicator of the\n                        state of the U.S. economy. Formally called the\n                        Manufacturing ISM Report on Business, the survey is\n                        conducted by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM).\n                        It indicates the level of demand for products by\n                        measuring the amount of ordering activity at the\n                        nation's factories.

This is\n                        because historically, the ISM predicts US GDP with a 12\n                        month time lags with 85% accuracy.\n                      </p>\n                      <p>\n                        There are ranks for each component of the ISM reports\n                        and the overall numbers.

estimated as 20.1B and 18.5B for the year 2021 and 2022 respectively. The high sales estimation is 22B and 36.6B & the low sales estimation is 16.9b and 10.2B for the year 2021 and 2022 respectively. Because of covid vaccine analyst are predicting high growth in the revenue. Moderna just got profitable in this quarture and has manage make margin of 68%.before it was loss making company. The margin of the comparable firm like Pfizer generally between 25% to 30%.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n                                                    Bank of America analyst Geoff Meacham wrote in a note published  that the current valuation remains “unreasonable.” In order to justify the market capitalization, an\tinvestor would need to assume that the company would sell up to 1.5 billion doses of its Covid-19 vaccine each year, and a 100% probability of success for the entire pipeline with aggregate peak sales of $30 billion.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n
